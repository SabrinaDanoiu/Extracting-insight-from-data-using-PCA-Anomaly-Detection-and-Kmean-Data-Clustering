One of the most powerful tendencies nowadays is directed towards Data Science, Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning because these domains are thought to have a great potential
based on their growth over the last few years. Basing their choice on these facts, many students
start showing an increasing interest towards these fields, as well as trying to start a career path
in this direction.


To help students who are trying to enter this career path, I developed this tool. It is meant to
help them understand theoretical concepts by exemplifying how some concepts work, not
being mandatory to know how to implement them from scratch. The utility of this tool lays in
the graphical features of the application, the user being able to see the data as a table or as a
plot.
